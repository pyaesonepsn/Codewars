/*
Character recognition software is widely used to digitise printed texts.
Thus the texts can be edited, searched and stored on a computer.

When documents (especially pretty old ones written with a typewriter),
are digitised character recognition softwares often make mistakes.

Your task is correct the errors in the digitised text. You only have to handle the following mistakes:

S is misinterpreted as 5
O is misinterpreted as 0
I is misinterpreted as 1
The test cases contain numbers only by mistake.

    // organize the corrections in a human-readable object/map
    const corrections = {
        "5": "S",
        "0": "O",
        "1": "I",
    };

    return (
        inputString
            // split the string into an array of characters
            .split("")
            // check if the current character is in the corrections object
            // if it is, correct it, else return it unchanged
            .map((char) =>
                corrections.hasOwnProperty(char) ? corrections[char] : char
            )
